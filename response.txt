I see what you mean. The Pokemon card market has indeed become quite popular and competitive lately, making it challenging to find good deals. Patience and perseverance can pay off though, so I hope you stumble upon the Blastoise card at a reasonable price. Have you considered any strategies for navigating the saturated market, like trading duplicates or focusing on specific sellers?
